# PersephoneP
PersephoneP is a web browser written by Python3 and PyQt5.
This browser is based on Chromium, which is an open source web broser engine included in PyQt5.
The data from web pages gotten by Chromium is drawn on PyQt Widgets.
PyQt is one of the most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform C++ framework.
Utilizing the characteristics of Qt as cross-platform framework, PersephoneP is able to run on multi-platform if python is installed.

# The reasons of Development
Some people say that making browser is reinventing the wheel, however, there are two reasons.

1. Understanding the way to get data from web page and to draw it on our PC.
1. Some workers, including me, are forced to use the IE at work. BUT, we wanna use other than IE!!
